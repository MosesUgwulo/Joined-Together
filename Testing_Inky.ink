=== WhoDoneIt
Peter: I believe I have found out who done it

Brendan: Really?
//Branching/decisions
* I doubted him.          
    Peter: How dare you doubt me 
    Brendan: By my wits, I'll show you.
    //Nested branching
    * * I showed him the bloody hankerchief 
        Peter: How horrifying!
        A gasp was heard in the room.
        
    * * I showed him the muddy bootprint
        Peter: How mystifying!
        
    -- Brendan: I thought you might say so. //Gathering/Rejoining
    
* I agreed that the culprint was known to all.
    Peter: Don't steal my thunder
    
    - Brendan: Let's just focus on the evidence shall we?
